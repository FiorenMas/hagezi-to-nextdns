# HaGeZi to NextDNS

This userscript allows you to:

1. Import or remove HaGeZi Most Abused TLDs list.
2. Import or remove HaGeZi allowlist (to be used with the aggressive variant of
 the TLD list).
3. Import or remove error trackers in case you want to use the Pro version
 onwards but allow them to help developers. Or vice versa, you want to use the
 Normal version but block the error trackers.
4. Import or remove custom lists (only wildcard asterisk or wildcard domain
 format is supported).
